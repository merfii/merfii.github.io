The sculpture Colibri, made by woodchips, mimics the motion of a hummingbird in flight. 
Every element of motion has been completely mechanized, from the beating wings to the flaring tail. Intricate systems of linkages and cams bring the sculpture to life with a continuous flow of meticulously timed articulations.As each mechanism has been linked to the next, Colibri cycles through its complete range of motions by the simple turn of a crank. 

This was originally a invention by [Derek Hugger](http://www.derekhugger.com/). I analysed its structure and imitated it from pictures.
Below is mines.

However, with the inappropriate tolerance for axes, my Colibri can hardly move. T_T. Though I can manage to install bearing to make it run, the consequential change of barycenter is unacceptable.una
