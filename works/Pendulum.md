An [inverted pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pendulum) is a pendulum that has its center of mass above its pivot point. It's naturally unstable and only maintain balance with external active control. The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory and is widely used as a benchmark for testing control algorithms.

This was a project in my fresh year of undergraduate, aiming to explore the the interesting character of inverted pendulum.
The core facility was transformed based on an abandoned ink-jet printer.
