Technologies are now merging at high speed, notably robotics and artificial intelligence. Robots have been applied on assembly lines for decades and we’ve recently welcomed them into our homes to help out with menial tasks, but It raises a lot of questions about man-machine relation. 

How automated do we want our world, our body to be? 

What physical, moral and legal framework should we use if human and robot live together?

If almost all work done by automation and machine, what consequences for human life? Which post-work society shall we build?

This is exactly the initial motivation of the photograph and installation. I want to express the fear, fascination and loss of all the mankind in the face of these big questions.

I believe one day, just like the naked man with robust  muscles, mankind must face these questions with totally naked in mind and need tough response.

This video makes efforts to show a new possibility of street dance. An interactive of human and robot may inspire the development and revise of tranditional styles.



The robot run on pre-programmed script, operating under open-loop mode. It's hard to synchronize to script steps and music rhythm because traditional robot controller runs at position control mode. New control law should be explored in order to fit the need of performance.

The UR5 is finicky about how it takes instructions. At the very end of development I found a way to get it working with a servo interface to reach the target position in real time. Despite these difficulties the UR5 is definitely the right robot for the job. 



In this machine-boom era, questions related to automation are popping up in everyone’s mind. We will have to answers them collectively, if possible.
