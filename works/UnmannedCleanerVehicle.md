This project was originally aimed at intergrating indoor cleanner with air purifier. And further more apply the SLAM(simultaneous localization and mapping) algorithm to automatically build the indoor map and plan a fesible path to trvel. In 2013, this idea was highly pioneer. But just during this project was going on, Neato and Samsung released their new products that equipped with laser scanner with highly matured localization performance. This project obsoleted since that.

I'm still insterested in and focusing on the news of SLAM algorithms since it's an essential technique for  driverless vihicles. I tried orbSLAM and Cartographer immediately after their release.
