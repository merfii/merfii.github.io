# Not all efforts pay off. 
Some projects got pushed aside for different reasons.
for example:

![bicycle]({{page.url}}bicycle1.jpg)
![bicycle]({{page.url}}bicycle2.jpg)

 This is a design for autopilot bicycle. It turned out only maintain balance for a very short period.
<br><br>

![rubic1]({{page.url}}rubic1.png)
![rubic2]({{page.url}}rubic2.png)
<br><br>

This is a design for Rubic's Cube solver.
## However, never put into practice. ##
